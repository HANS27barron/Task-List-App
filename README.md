# Task-List-App

My first project using Flutter and Android Studios.

## What it is

This app allows to type in tasks as a list. These tasks can be marked as completed, and you have the ability to erease all tasks from the list or only those marked completed. You can also scroll the tasks to delete it. The username can also be changed in Settings.
